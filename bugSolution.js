The solution often involves carefully reviewing the project's `package.json` and `app.json` files for inconsistencies.  Check for version conflicts among Expo modules and other dependencies. You might need to use `npm prune` or `npm dedupe` to resolve dependency issues. Ensure that the versions of packages are compatible with each other and with the Expo SDK version specified. Sometimes, a complete removal of the `node_modules` folder followed by reinstalling packages (`npm install`) can resolve the problem.  Here's an example of how to improve `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-expo-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^48.0.15",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "expo-status-bar": ">=1.4.4 < 2.0.0",
    // ...other dependencies, ensuring no version conflicts
  }
}
```

In some cases, you might need to update the Expo CLI itself or create a new Expo project and carefully move code and assets to ensure a clean environment.
