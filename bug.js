This error typically occurs when using Expo CLI with projects that have unexpected or improperly configured dependencies. It might manifest as an inability to start the development server or build the application, often accompanied by confusing error messages that don't point directly to the root cause.  One common scenario involves mismatched versions of Expo modules or conflicting packages within the project's dependencies.  Another cause can be issues related to the project's `package.json` file and manifest file.  Incorrect configuration in these files can lead to unexpected behavior and obscure errors.
